                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>, born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, emerged as one of India's most eminent scientists and the 11th President of India. Kalam's early life was marked by hardship, yet he was a diligent student with a keen interest in learning. After completing his education at the Madras Institute of Technology, he joined the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). <br>

                    Kalam played a pivotal role in India's space and missile development programs. He was instrumental in the development of the SLV-III, India's first satellite launch vehicle, which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in orbit in 1980. Known as the "Missile Man of India," he also led the development of ballistic missiles like Agni and Prithvi. <br>

                    In 1998, Kalam was a key figure in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests, which established India as a nuclear power. His contributions to science and technology earned him numerous awards, including the Bharat Ratna, Indiaâ€™s highest civilian honor. <br>

                    In 2002, Kalam was elected President of India, serving until 2007. Known for his accessibility and rapport with the public, especially the youth, he earned the nickname "People's President." His presidency was marked by efforts to promote education, innovation, and national development. <br>

                    Post-presidency, Kalam continued to engage with the youth, advocating for visionaries and innovation through his lectures and books. His works, such as "Wings of Fire," "India 2020," and "Ignited Minds," inspire countless individuals. <br>

                    Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, leaving behind a legacy of inspiration, dedication, and service to the nation. His life story is a testament to the power of perseverance, vision, and the pursuit of knowledge. <br>
